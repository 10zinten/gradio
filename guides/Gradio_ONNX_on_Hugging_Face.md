## What is ONNX Model Zoo?

Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open standard format for representing machine learning models. ONNX is supported by a community of partners who have implemented it in many frameworks and tools. The ONNX model zoo is a collection of pre-trained, state-of-the-art models in the ONNX format. More details on the ONNX model zoo github: https://github.com/onnx/models

## What is HF Spaces & Gradio?

### Gradio

Gradio lets users demo their machine learning models as a web app all in python code. Gradio demos can work inside jupyter notebooks, colab, embedded in your own website and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for free.

for more info see: https://gradio.app/

### Hugging Face Spaces

Hugging Face Spaces is a free hosting option for Gradio demos on Hugging Face. Spaces comes with 3 sdks, Gradio, Streamlit and Static HTML demos. Spaces can be public or private and the workflow is similar to github repos.
