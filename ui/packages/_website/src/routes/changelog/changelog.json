{"content": "# Upcoming Release\n\n# 3.19.0\n\n\n\n## Bug Fixes:\n- UI fixes including footer and API docs by [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 3242](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3242)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Improved embedding experience\n\nWhen embedding a spaces-hosted gradio app as a web component, you now get an improved UI linking back to the original space, better error handling and more intelligent load performance. No changes are required to your code to benefit from this enhanced experience; simply upgrade your gradio SDK to the latest version.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12937446/219653294-86937632-72c1-4e93-a77c-af705d49382a.png)\n\nThis behaviour is configurable. You can disable the info panel at the bottom by passing `info=\"false\"`. You can disable the container entirely by passing `container=\"false\"`.\n\nError statuses are reported in the UI with an easy way for end-users to report problems to the original space author via the community tab of that Hugginface space:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12937446/219655499-88019443-d694-44e7-9e6d-242e19d10a5c.png)\n\nBy default, gradio apps are lazy loaded, vastly improving performance when there are several demos on the page. Metadata is loaded ahead of time, but the space will only be loaded and rendered when it is in view.\n\nThis behaviour is configurable. You can pass `eager=\"true\"` to load and render the space regardless of whether or not it is currently on the screen.\n\nby [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn) in [PR 3205](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3205)\n\n### New `gr.BarPlot` component! \ud83d\udcca\n\nCreate interactive bar plots from a high-level interface with `gr.BarPlot`. \nNo need to remember matplotlib syntax anymore!\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport pandas as pd\n\nsimple = pd.DataFrame({\n    'a': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I'],\n    'b': [28, 55, 43, 91, 81, 53, 19, 87, 52]\n})\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.BarPlot(\n        simple,\n        x=\"a\",\n        y=\"b\",\n        title=\"Simple Bar Plot with made up data\",\n        tooltip=['a', 'b'],\n    )\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n\nBy [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 3157](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3157)\n\n### Bokeh plots are back! \ud83c\udf20\n\nFixed a bug that prevented bokeh plots from being displayed on the front end and extended support for both 2.x and 3.x versions of bokeh!\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41651716/219468324-0d82e07f-8fb4-4ff9-b40c-8250b29e45f7.png)\n\nBy [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 3212](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3212)\n\n\n## Bug Fixes:\n- Adds ability to add a single message from the bot or user side.

This will run the event every given number of seconds!\n\nThis can be used to:\n* Create live visualizations that show the most up to date data\n* Refresh the state of the frontend automatically in response to changes in the backend\n\nHere is an example of a live plot that refreshes every half second:\n```python\nimport math\nimport gradio as gr\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nplot_end = 2 * math.pi\n\n\ndef get_plot(period=1):\n    global plot_end\n    x = np.arange(plot_end - 2 * math.pi, plot_end, 0.02)\n    y = np.sin(2*math.pi*period * x)\n    fig = px.line(x=x, y=y)\n    plot_end += 2 * math.pi\n    return fig\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.Markdown(\"Change the value of the slider to automatically update the plot\")\n            period = gr.Slider(label=\"Period of plot\", value=1, minimum=0, maximum=10, step=1)\n            plot = gr.Plot(label=\"Plot (updates every half second)\")\n\n    dep = demo.load(get_plot, None, plot, every=0.5)\n    period.change(get_plot, period, plot, every=0.5, cancels=[dep])\n\ndemo.queue().launch()\n```\n\n![live_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41651716/198357377-633ce460-4e31-47bd-8202-1440cdd6fe19.gif)\n\n\n\n\n## Documentation Changes:\n* Explained how to set up `queue` and `auth` when working with reload mode by by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 3089](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3089) \n\n\n\n\n\n## Full Changelog:\n* Allows loading private Spaces by passing an an `api_key` to `gr.Interface.load()`\nby [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2568](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2568)\n\n\n\n\n# Version 3.8\n\n## New Features:\n* Allows event listeners to accept a single dictionary as its argument, where the keys are the components and the values are the component values. This is set by passing the input components in the event listener as a set instead of a list. [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2550](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2550)\n\n## Bug Fixes:\n* Fix whitespace issue when using plotly. [@dawoodkhan82](https://github.com/dawoodkhan82) in [PR 2548](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2548)\n* Apply appropriate alt text to all gallery images. [@camenduru](https://github.com/camenduru) in [PR 2358](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2538)\n* Removed erroneous tkinter import in gradio.blocks by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2555](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2555)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Full Changelog:\n* Added the `every` keyword to event listeners that runs events on a fixed schedule by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2512](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2512)\n* Fix whitespace issue when using plotly.

[@camenduru](https://github.com/camenduru) in [PR 2358](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2538)\n\n\n\n\n# Version 3.7\n\n## New Features:\n\n### Batched Functions\n\nGradio now supports the ability to pass *batched* functions. Batched functions are just\nfunctions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.\n\nFor example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of\nwords and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:\n\n```py\nimport time\n\ndef trim_words(words, lens):\n    trimmed_words = []\n    time.sleep(5)\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:l])\n    return [trimmed_words]\n```\n\nThe advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio\nserver can automatically *batch* incoming requests and process them in parallel,\npotentially speeding up your demo. Here's what the Gradio code looks like (notice\nthe `batch=True` and `max_batch_size=16` -- both of these parameters can be passed\ninto event triggers or into the `Interface` class)\n\n```py\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        word = gr.Textbox(label=\"word\", value=\"abc\")\n        leng = gr.Number(label=\"leng\", precision=0, value=1)\n        output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        run = gr.Button()\n\n    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\n\ndemo.queue()\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nIn the example above, 16 requests could be processed in parallel (for a total inference\ntime of 5 seconds), instead of each request being processed separately (for a total\ninference time of 80 seconds).\n\n### Upload Event\n\n`Video`, `Audio`, `Image`, and `File` components now support a `upload()` event that is triggered when a user uploads a file into any of these components.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```py\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        input_video = gr.Video()\n        output_video = gr.Video()\n\n     # Clears the output video when an input video is uploaded\n    input_video.upload(lambda : None, None, output_video)\n```\n\n\n## Bug Fixes:\n* Fixes issue where plotly animations, interactivity, titles, legends, were not working properly.

This is optional and the component also accepts just a list of the images.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nimages_with_captions = [\n    (\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551969014-7d2c4cddf0b6\", \"Cheetah by David Groves\"),\n    (\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546182990-dffeafbe841d\", \"Lion by Francesco\"),\n    (\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1561731216-c3a4d99437d5\", \"Tiger by Mike Marrah\")\n    ]\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Gallery(value=images_with_captions)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192399521-7360b1a9-7ce0-443e-8e94-863a230a7dbe.gif\" alt=\"gallery_captions\" width=\"1000\"/>\n\n### 2. Type Values into the Slider \ud83d\udd22\n\nYou can now type values directly on the Slider component! Here's what it looks like:\n\n![type-slider](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192399877-76b662a1-fede-4417-a932-fc15f0da7360.gif)\n\n### 3. Better Sketching and Inpainting \ud83c\udfa8\n\nWe've made a lot of changes to our Image component so that it can support better sketching and inpainting.\n\nNow supports:\n* A standalone black-and-white sketch\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\ndemo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Sketchpad(), gr.Image())\ndemo.launch()\n```\n![bw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410264-b08632b5-7b2a-4f86-afb0-5760e7b474cf.gif)\n\n\n* A standalone color sketch\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\ndemo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Paint(), gr.Image())\ndemo.launch()\n```\n![color-sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410500-3c8c3e64-a5fd-4df2-a991-f0a5cef93728.gif)\n\n\n* An uploadable image with black-and-white or color sketching\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\ndemo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Image(source='upload', tool='color-sketch'), gr.Image()) # for black and white, tool = 'sketch'\ndemo.launch()\n```\n![sketch-new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192402422-e53cb7b6-024e-448c-87eb-d6a35a63c476.gif)\n\n\n* Webcam with black-and-white or color sketching\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\ndemo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Image(source='webcam', tool='color-sketch'), gr.Image()) # for black and white, tool = 'sketch'\ndemo.launch()\n```\n![webcam-sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410820-0ffaf324-776e-4e1f-9de6-0fdbbf4940fa.gif)\n\n\nAs well as other fixes\n\n\n## Bug Fixes:\n1.

Iterative Outputs \u23f3\n\nYou can now create an iterative output simply by having your function return a generator!\n\nHere's (part of) an example that was used to generate the interface below it. [See full code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9bWS6B82CT7bw-m4L6AJR8za7fEK7Ov?usp=sharing).\n\n```python\ndef predict(steps, seed):\n    generator = torch.manual_seed(seed)\n    for i in range(1,steps):\n        yield pipeline(generator=generator, num_inference_steps=i)[\"sample\"][0]\n```\n\n\n![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/189086273-f5e7087d-71fa-4158-90a9-08e84da0421c.mp4)\n\n### 2. Accordion Layout \ud83c\udd95\n\nThis version of Gradio introduces a new layout component to Blocks: the Accordion. Wrap your elements in a neat, expandable layout that allows users to toggle them as needed.\n\nUsage: ([Read the docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#accordion))\n\n```python\nwith gr.Accordion(\"open up\"):\n# components here\n```\n\n![accordion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/189088465-f0ffd7f0-fc6a-42dc-9249-11c5e1e0529b.gif)\n\n### 3. Skops Integration \ud83d\udcc8\n\nOur new integration with [skops](https://huggingface.co/blog/skops) allows you to load tabular classification and regression models directly from the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models).\n\nHere's a classification example showing how quick it is to set up an interface for a [model](https://huggingface.co/scikit-learn/tabular-playground).\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\ngr.Interface.load(\"models/scikit-learn/tabular-playground\").launch()\n```\n\n![187936493-5c90c01d-a6dd-400f-aa42-833a096156a1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/189090519-328fbcb4-120b-43c8-aa54-d6fccfa6b7e8.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Full Changelog:\n\n* safari fixes by [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn) in [PR 2138](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2138)\n* Fix roundedness and form borders by [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2147](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2147)\n* Better processing of example data prior to creating dataset component by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2147](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2147)\n* Show error on Connection drops by [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2147](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2147)\n* 3.2 release! by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2139](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2139)\n* Fixed Named API Requests by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2151](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2151)\n* Quick Fix: Cannot upload Model3D image after clearing it by [@dawoodkhan82](https://github.com/dawoodkhan82) in [PR 2168](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2168)\n* Fixed misleading log when server_name is '0.0.0.0' by [@lamhoangtung](https://github.com/lamhoangtung) in [PR 2176](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2176)\n* Keep embedded PngInfo metadata by [@cobryan05](https://github.com/cobryan05) in [PR 2170](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2170)\n* Skops integration: Load tabular classification and regression models from the hub by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2126](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2126)\n* Respect original filename when cached example files are downloaded by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2145](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2145)\n* Add manual trigger to deploy to pypi by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2192](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2192)\n* Fix bugs with gr.update by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2157](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2157)\n* Make queue per app by [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2193](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2193)\n* Preserve Labels In Interpretation Components by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2166](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2166)\n* Quick Fix: Multiple file download not working by [@dawoodkhan82](https://github.com/dawoodkhan82) in [PR 2169](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2169)\n* use correct MIME type for js-script file by [@daspartho](https://github.com/daspartho) in [PR 2200](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2200)\n* Add accordion component by [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2208](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2208)\n\n\n## Contributors Shoutout:\n\n* [@lamhoangtung](https://github.com/lamhoangtung) made their first contribution in [PR 2176](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2176)\n* [@cobryan05](https://github.com/cobryan05) made their first contribution in [PR 2170](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2170)\n* [@daspartho](https://github.com/daspartho) made their first contribution in [PR 2200](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2200)\n\n# Version 3.2\n\n## New Features:\n\n### 1. Improvements to Queuing \ud83e\udd47\n\nWe've implemented a brand new queuing system based on **web sockets** instead of HTTP long polling. Among other things, this allows us to manage queue sizes better on Hugging Face Spaces. There are also additional queue-related parameters you can add:\n\n* Now supports concurrent workers (parallelization)\n```python\ndemo = gr.Interface(...)\ndemo.queue(concurrency_count=3)\ndemo.launch()\n```\n* Configure a maximum queue size\n```python\ndemo = gr.Interface(...)\ndemo.queue(max_size=100)\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n* If a user closes their tab / browser, they leave the queue, which means the demo will run faster for everyone else\n\n### 2. Fixes to Examples\n\n* Dataframe examples will render properly, and look much clearer in the UI: (thanks to PR #2125)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-30 at 8 29 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187586561-d915bafb-f968-4966-b9a2-ef41119692b2.png)\n\n* Image and Video thumbnails are cropped to look neater and more uniform: (thanks to PR #2109)\n\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-30 at 8 32 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187586890-56e1e4f0-1b84-42d9-a82f-911772c41030.png)\n\n* Other fixes in PR #2131 and #2064  make it easier to design and use Examples\n\n### 3. Component Fixes \ud83e\uddf1\n* Specify the width and height of an image in its style tag (thanks to PR #2133)\n```python\ncomponents.Image().style(height=260, width=300)\n```\n* Automatic conversion of videos so they are playable in the browser (thanks to PR #2003). Gradio will check if a video's format is playable  in the browser and, if it isn't, will automatically convert it to a format that is (mp4).\n* Pass in a json filepath to the Label component (thanks to PR #2083)\n* Randomize the default value of a Slider (thanks to PR #1935)\n\n![slider-random](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187596230-3db9697f-9f4d-42f5-9387-d77573513448.gif)\n\n\n* Improvements to State in PR #2100\n\n### 4. Ability to Randomize Input Sliders and Reload Data whenever the Page Loads\n* In some cases, you want to be able to show a different set of input data to every user as they load the page app. For example, you might want to randomize the value of a \"seed\" `Slider` input. Or you might want to show a `Textbox` with the current date. We now supporting passing _functions_ as the default value in input components. When you pass in a function, it gets **re-evaluated** every time someone loads the demo, allowing you to reload / change data for different users.\n\nHere's an example loading the current date time into an input Textbox:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport datetime\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Textbox(datetime.datetime.now)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nNote that we don't evaluate the function -- `datetime.datetime.now()` -- we pass in the function itself to get this behavior -- `datetime.datetime.now`\n\nBecause randomizing the initial value of `Slider` is a common use case, we've added a `randomize` keyword argument you can use to randomize its initial value:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\ndemo = gr.Interface(lambda x:x, gr.Slider(0, 10, randomize=True), \"number\")\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n### 5.

Embedding Demos on Any Website \ud83d\udcbb\n\nWith PR #1444, Gradio is now distributed as a web component. This means demos can be natively embedded on websites. You'll just need to add two lines: one to load the gradio javascript, and one to link to the demos backend.\n\nHere's a simple example that embeds the demo from a Hugging Face space:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"https://gradio.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3.0.18/gradio.js\"></script>\n<gradio-app space=\"abidlabs/pytorch-image-classifier\"></gradio-app>\n```\n\nBut you can also embed demos that are running anywhere, you just need to link the demo to `src` instead of `space`. In fact, all the demos on the gradio website are embedded this way:\n\n<img width=\"1268\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 2 41 44 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178997124-b2f05af2-c18f-4716-bf1b-cb971d012636.png\">\n\n\nRead more in the [Embedding Gradio Demos](https://gradio.app/embedding_gradio_demos) guide.\n\n### 2. Reload Mode \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\n\nReload mode helps developers create gradio demos faster by automatically reloading the demo whenever the code changes. It can support development on Python IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm, etc), the terminal, as well as Jupyter notebooks.\n\nIf your demo code is in a script named `app.py`, instead of running `python app.py` you can now run `gradio app.py` and that will launch the demo in reload mode:\n\n```bash\nLaunching in reload mode on: http://127.0.0.1:7860 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nWatching...\nWARNING: The --reload flag should not be used in production on Windows.\n```\n\nIf you're working from a Jupyter or Colab Notebook, use these magic commands instead: `%load_ext gradio` when you import gradio, and `%%blocks` in the top of the cell with the demo code. Here's an example that shows how much faster the development becomes:\n\n![Blocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178986488-ed378cc8-5141-4330-ba41-672b676863d0.gif)\n\n### 3. Inpainting Support on `gr.Image()` \ud83c\udfa8\n\nWe updated the Image component to add support for inpainting demos. It works by adding `tool=\"sketch\"` as a parameter, that passes both an image and a sketchable mask to your prediction function.\n\nHere's an example from the [LAMA space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/lama):\n\n![FXApVlFVsAALSD-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178989479-549867c8-7fb0-436a-a97d-1e91c9f5e611.jpeg)\n\n### 4. Markdown and HTML support in Dataframes \ud83d\udd22\n\nWe upgraded the Dataframe component in PR #1684 to support rendering Markdown and HTML inside the cells.\n\nThis means you can build Dataframes that look like the following:\n\n![image (8)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178991233-41cb07a5-e7a3-433e-89b8-319bc78eb9c2.png)\n\n\n### 5. `gr.Examples()` for Blocks \ud83e\uddf1\n\nWe've added the `gr.Examples` component helper to allow you to add examples to any Blocks demo. This class is a wrapper over the `gr.Dataset` component.\n\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 2 23 50 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178992715-c8bc7550-bc3d-4ddc-9fcb-548c159cd153.png\">\n\n\ngr.Examples takes two required parameters:\n\n- `examples` which takes in a nested list\n-  `inputs` which takes in a component or list of components\n\nYou can read more in the [Examples docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#examples) or the [Adding Examples to your Demos guide](https://gradio.app/adding_examples_to_your_app/).\n\n### 6. Fixes to Audio Streaming\n\nWith [PR 1828](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1828) we now hide the status loading animation, as well as remove the echo in streaming. Check out the [stream_audio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/stream_audio/run.py) demo for more or read through our [Real Time Speech Recognition](https://gradio.app/real_time_speech_recognition/) guide.\n\n<img width=\"785\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-07-19 at 6 02 35 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/179808136-9e84502c-f9ee-4f30-b5e9-1086f678fe91.png\">\n\n\n## Full Changelog:\n\n* File component: list multiple files and allow for download #1446 by [@dawoodkhan82](https://github.com/dawoodkhan82) in [PR 1681](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1681)\n* Add ColorPicker to docs by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 1768](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1768)\n* Mock out requests in TestRequest unit tests by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 1794](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1794)\n* Add requirements.txt and test_files to source dist by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 1817](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1817)\n* refactor: f-string for tunneling.py by [@nhankiet](https://github.com/nhankiet) in [PR 1819](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1819)\n* Miscellaneous formatting improvements to website by [@aliabd](https://github.com/aliabd) in [PR 1754](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1754)\n* `integrate()` method moved to `Blocks` by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 1776](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1776)\n* Add python-3.7 tests by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 1818](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1818)\n* Copy test dir in website dockers by [@aliabd](https://github.com/aliabd) in [PR 1827](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1827)\n* Add info to docs on how to set default values for components by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 1788](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1788)\n* Embedding Components on Docs by [@aliabd](https://github.com/aliabd) in [PR 1726](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1726)\n* Remove usage of deprecated gr.inputs and gr.outputs from website by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 1796](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1796)\n* Some cleanups to the docs page by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 1822](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1822)\n\n## Contributors Shoutout:\n* [@nhankiet](https://github.com/nhankiet) made their first contribution in [PR 1819](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1819)\n\n# Version 3.0\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 Gradio 3.0 is the biggest update to the library, ever.\n\n## New Features:\n\n### 1.  Blocks \ud83e\uddf1\n\nBlocks is a new, low-level API that allows you to have full control over the data flows and layout of your application. It allows you to build very complex, multi-step applications. For example, you might want to:\n\n* Group together related demos as multiple tabs in one web app\n* Change the layout of your demo instead of just having all of the inputs on the left and outputs on the right\n* Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general\n* Change a component's properties (for example, the choices in a Dropdown) or its visibility based on user input\n\nHere's a simple example that creates the demo below it:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef update(name):\n    return f\"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!\"\n\ndemo = gr.Blocks()\n\nwith demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\n    \"\"\"\n    # Hello World!\n    Start typing below to see the output.\n    \"\"\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=update,\n               inputs=inp,\n               outputs=out)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n![hello-blocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168684108-78cbd24b-e6bd-4a04-a8d9-20d535203434.gif)\n\n\nRead our [Introduction to Blocks](http://gradio.app/introduction_to_blocks/) guide for more, and join the \ud83c\udf88 [Gradio Blocks Party](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gradio-Blocks/README)!\n\n\n### 2. Our Revamped Design \ud83c\udfa8\n\nWe've upgraded our design across the entire library: from components, and layouts all the way to dark mode.\n\n![kitchen_sink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168686333-7a6e3096-3e23-4309-abf2-5cd7736e0463.gif)\n\n\n### 3. A New Website \ud83d\udcbb\n\nWe've upgraded [gradio.app](https://gradio.app) to make it cleaner, faster and easier to use. Our docs now come with components and demos embedded directly on the page. So you can quickly get up to speed with what you're looking for.\n\n![website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168687191-10d6a3bd-101f-423a-8193-48f47a5e077d.gif)\n\n\n### 4. New Components: Model3D, Dataset, and More..\n\nWe've introduced a lot of new components in `3.0`, including `Model3D`, `Dataset`, `Markdown`, `Button` and `Gallery`. You can find all the components and play around with them [here](https://gradio.app/docs/#components).\n\n\n![Model3d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168689062-6ad77151-8cc5-467d-916c-f7c78e52ec0c.gif)\n\n## Full Changelog:\n\n* Gradio
